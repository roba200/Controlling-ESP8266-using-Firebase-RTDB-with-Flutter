# ESP8266 LCD Display and Light Control with Flutter and Firebase
This project demonstrates how to use an ESP8266 microcontroller to display text input on an LCD screen and control a light bulb, and how to control the light bulb with a Flutter app that uses Firebase Realtime Database (RTDB).

The ESP8266 is programmed using the Arduino IDE and the ESP8266WiFi library. The LCD display is controlled with the LiquidCrystal library, and the light bulb is controlled with a relay module.

The Flutter app uses the Firebase RTDB to communicate with the ESP8266 and control the light bulb. Users can input text on the app and see it displayed on the LCD screen, and can toggle the light bulb on and off.
